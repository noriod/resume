## Recent Projects

### Scheduling Application

This application solved the problem of needing to schedule data extracts from Expeditors internal systems at varying intervals in order to send reports to customers. Employees log in and configure when reports should be generated. At the specified time the application performs service calls to the EDI application to generate the report. Failures are captured and reported on a dashboard within the application as well as via email.

**Front end**: AngularJS, Bootstrap
**Back end**: Java, Spring, Quartz (Scheduling library)
**Database**: MongoDB


### Continuous Integration Implementation

Setup a continuous integration environment for an EDI integration environment. Prior to this project developers had to manually build, run tests, and deploy their code into four different environments (sandbox, dev, QA, and production). 

With the new continuous integration implementation in place, developers simply check their changes into Subversion and then tag specific revisions to an environment. Jenkins then detects the tagging an automatically builds, tests, and deploys their changes into the correct environment. This created significant time savings for developers in addition to cutting back on errors commonly made during the manual process.

**Technologies Uses:** Jenkins, Subversion, Groovy, Ant
