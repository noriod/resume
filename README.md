## Recent Projects

### Scheduling Application

This application solved the problem of needing to schedule data extracts from Expeditors internal systems at varying intervals based on when customers needed reports. 

A custom front-end was written in AngularJS and Bootstrap to allow teams working on report creation to easily schedule reports. The back-end utilized the Quartz library to schedule the reports. Custom Jobs were implemented for invoking REST service calls to generate the reports.

**Technologies Used:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Spring Security, AngularJS, Bootstrap, MongoDB

### Continuous Integration Implementation

Setup a continuous integration environment for an EDI integration environment. Prior to this project developers had to manually build, run tests, and deploy their code into four different environments (sandbox, dev, QA, and production). 

With the new continuous integration implementation in place, developers simply check their changes into Subversion and then tag specific revisions to an environment. Jenkins then detects the tagging an automatically builds, tests, and deploys their changes into the correct environment. This created significant time savings for developers in addition to cutting back on errors commonly made during the manual process.

**Technologies Uses:** Jenkins, Subversion, Groovy, Ant
